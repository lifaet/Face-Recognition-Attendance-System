# Face Recognition Attendance System

## üìã Overview
The Face Recognition Attendance System is a cutting-edge solution that automates attendance tracking using advanced facial recognition technology. This intelligent system combines computer vision, machine learning, and automated record-keeping to create a seamless attendance management experience.

Operating in real-time, it captures video feed, detects faces, matches them against a database, and automatically records attendance with timestamps. Built with privacy and security in mind, it ensures accurate recognition while maintaining data protection standards.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition (>95% accuracy)
- Automated attendance logging with timestamps
- User-friendly interface with visual feedback
- Multi-face detection capability
- Privacy-focused design with secure data storage
- Configurable system parameters
- Comprehensive error logging

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Visual Studio Build Tools with C++
- CMake
- Webcam (720p minimum)
- 4GB+ RAM

### Installation
1. **Install Build Tools**
   ```bash
   # Download and install Visual Studio Community Edition with "Desktop Development with C++"

   ```

2. **Clone & Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face-Recognition-Attendance-System.git
   cd Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
   pip install cmake dlib face-recognition numpy opencv-python
   ```

## üì± Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Add face photos to `attendees/` folder (format: `firstname_lastname.jpg`)
2. Configure system parameters in `config.json`
3. Ensure proper lighting and camera positioning

### Running the System
```bash
python Attendance.py
```
- Stand in front of camera for recognition
- View real-time feedback
- Press 'Q' to exit
