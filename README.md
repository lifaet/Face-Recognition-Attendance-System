# Face Recognition Attendance System

## 📋 Overview
The Face Recognition Attendance System is a cutting-edge solution that automates attendance tracking using advanced facial recognition technology. This intelligent system combines computer vision, machine learning, and automated record-keeping to create a seamless attendance management experience.

Operating in real-time, it captures video feed, detects faces, matches them against a database, and automatically records attendance with timestamps. Built with privacy and security in mind, it ensures accurate recognition while maintaining data protection standards.


## ✨ Key Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition (>95% accuracy)
- Automated attendance logging with timestamps
- User-friendly interface with visual feedback
- Multi-face detection capability
- Privacy-focused design with secure data storage
- Configurable system parameters
- Comprehensive error logging

## ⚙️ Configuration
The system can be configured via `config.json`:

```json
{
    "path": "attendees",
    "frame_skip": 2,
    "face_recognition_threshold": 0.50,
    "attendance_file": "attendance.csv",
    "ui": {
        "analyzing_text": "Analyzing...",
        "welcome_text": "Welcome,",
        "unknown_text": "Unknown Person",
        "display_time": 3
    }
}
```


## 📱 Usage

### Setting Up Reference Images
1. Create clear face photos of individuals
2. Name format: `firstname_lastname.jpg`
3. Place images in the `attendees/` folder

### Running the System
1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python Attendance.py
   ```
2. System will initialize and load face data
3. Stand in front of camera for recognition
4. View real-time feedback on screen
5. Press 'Q' to exit

### Checking Attendance
- Open `attendance.csv` to view records
- Format: Name, Date, Time


## 🔍 Technical Details

### Face Recognition Process
1. Face Detection
   - Locates faces in video feed
   - Processes at 1/4 resolution for performance

2. Face Recognition
   - Converts detected faces to encodings
   - Matches against known face database
   - Threshold-based verification

3. Attendance Marking
   - Automatic date and time stamping
   - Duplicate entry prevention
   - CSV format storage

### UI Features
- Status messages for:
  - Face analysis in progress
  - Welcome messages
  - Unknown person alerts
- Visual indicators:
  - Green rectangle around detected faces
  - Checkmark for successful recognition
- Semi-transparent overlay


## 📊 Performance
- Frame skipping for optimal performance
- Configurable recognition threshold
- Efficient image processing
- Memory-optimized operations


## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Face Detection Engine**
   - OpenCV-based detection
   - 1/4 resolution processing for optimization
   - 30 FPS processing speed

2. **Recognition System**
   - dlib's 128-point facial landmarks
   - Configurable matching threshold
   - Multi-face database support

3. **Attendance Management**
   - Automated CSV recording
   - Duplicate entry prevention
   - Timestamp tracking

### System Requirements
| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
